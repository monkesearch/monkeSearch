A prototype system that brings semantic search capabilities to your file system using a very low profile vector database (size in a few KBs / MBs only), allowing you to search for files using natural language queries with temporal awareness like "documents from last week" or "photos from 3 days ago". Nothing leaves your PC, fully offline with local vector embeddings.


> ⚠️ **Prototype**: This is an initial proof-of-concept implementation. Expect rough edges and limited functionality.
> Currently aimed at macOS but the logic is independent for cross platform adaptations. (In the works!) visit [discussions](https://github.com/monkesearch/monkeSearch/discussions/8)

> ### Developer note:
> I've been working on this project since long and this idea had many versions. The current implementation uses LEANN, a vector database that saves 97% storage compared to traditional solutions. The system builds a semantic index of your files' metadata and enables temporal-aware search through regex parsing.
> The current turnaround time for this tool to receive a query and return files is sub-second thanks to LEANN's efficient code. This is under active
> development and any new suggestions + PRs are welcome. My goal for this tool is to be open source, safe and cross platform. So developers experienced in Windows/Linux Indexing are
> very welcome to collaborate and develop their versions together.

## Overview
Read the technical details at [technical.md](src/technical.md)

This system combines:
- **LEANN vector database** for semantic search with 97% storage savings
- **Native macOS Spotlight integration** for fast, efficient file metadata extraction
- **Temporal expression parsing** for time-based searches (3 weeks ago, 10 months ago, etc.)
- **Semantic similarity matching** using embeddings instead of exact keyword matching

## Implementation versions
There are multiple implementations in different branches written in achieving the same task, for testing purposes. Rigorous evals and testing will be done before finalizing on a single one for the main release. For the current version, I collaborated with the developers of LEANN (2.6k stars on GitHub) and contributed to both the repositories. 

> **For Agentic Use:** The legacy LLM-based implementations (branches below) are particularly suitable for integration into larger AI pipelines and agentic systems. These versions allow direct filesystem access through natural language without modifying any files, leveraging OS-level scoped safety through Spotlight. If you're building autonomous agents or LLM orchestration systems that need file discovery capabilities, these branches provide a direct LLM-to-filesystem bridge without the overhead of maintaining a separate index.

- [Initial implementation using LangExtract](https://github.com/monkesearch/monkeSearch/tree/feature/llama-cpp-support) (Legacy - LLM based, ideal for agentic pipelines)
- **Current main branch**: LEANN-based semantic search with temporal awareness via regex parsing 
- llama.cpp rewrite (legacy-main-llm-implementation) - deprecated but useful for direct LLM integration
- llama.cpp [feature branch](https://github.com/monkesearch/monkeSearch/tree/feature/chunking) - another variation of the llama.cpp rewrite, with a detailed response model.

## Example Queries
#### The system performs semantic search on file metadata with temporal filtering, understanding context without exact keyword matching

| Natural Language Query | What It Finds |
|------------------------|---------------|
| `"photos from wedding"` | Image files with name/ path including the keyword wedding (semantic match on "wedding") |
| `"documents from 3 weeks ago"` | Any document-like files from 3 weeks ago |
| `"old music files"` | Audio files with temporal context |
| `"invoices from last month"` | Files semantically similar to "invoices" from last month |
| `"presentations about 2 months ago"` | Files matching "presentations" context from ~2 months ago |
| `"downloads from last week"` | Files in downloads folder from last week |

## Requirements

- **macOS** (required for Spotlight integration, cross platform support in works.)
- **Python 3.8+**

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/monkesearch/monkesearch
cd monkeSearch
```

### 2. Install dependencies using the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Build the Index
```bash
# First, dump Spotlight metadata
python spotlight_dump.py 1000  # Dump 1000 files

# Build LEANN index
python build_index.py spotlight_dump.json

# The default recompute settings for LEANN are set to false, so the index size might be comparatively large.
```

### 4. Verify Setup
```bash
# Test search
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "pdf documents 2 weeks ago"
```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
cd app/

# Basic semantic search
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "photos"

# Temporal search
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "documents from 3 days ago"
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "downloads from last week"
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "files from around 2 months ago"

# Specify number of results (top-k)
python leann-plus-temporal-search.py "presentations" 10
```

### As a Module
```python
from search_index import search_files

# Perform a semantic search with temporal filtering
results = search_files("documents from last week", top_k=15)

# Results are SearchResult objects with score, text, and metadata
for result in results:
    print(f"Score: {result.score}")
    print(f"File: {result.text}")
    print(f"Created: {result.metadata.get('creation_date')}")
```

## Usage (Windows)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

### dump metadata using os.walk 
```bash
python app/os_walk_dump.py 1000 [change number of files to index]
```

### build chromadb index 
```bash
python app/chroma_index_builder.py os_walk_dump.json
```

### search 
```bash
python app/chroma-plus-temporal-search.py "presentations from last month"
```

## How It Works

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Spotlight metadata is extracted for files (name, path, type, dates)
2. **Embedding Generation**: File metadata is converted to embeddings using sentence transformers
3. **LEANN Indexing**: Embeddings are stored in a graph-based index with 97% storage savings (not enabled by default for now)
4. **Query Processing**: 
   - Temporal expressions are extracted via regex ("3 days ago" → ISO timestamp range)
   - Stop words are removed from temporal parsing
   - Clean query is embedded for semantic search
5. **Search & Filter**: LEANN performs semantic search, then results are filtered by date if temporal expression found

## Limitations

- **Indexed Files Only**: Only searches files indexed by Spotlight
- **Metadata-based**: Searches file metadata, not file contents (can be added as a feature later)
- **Basic Temporal Parsing**: Currently supports simple time expressions
